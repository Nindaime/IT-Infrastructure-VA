Advanced Cloud Security Check,1,"We use a dedicated secrets management service (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) with automated key rotation.",2,"Best practice. Centralizes secrets, controls access, and automates rotation to minimize exposure."
Advanced Cloud Security Check,1,Keys are stored as environment variables on servers and rotated manually every 90 days.,1,"A good, common practice, but manual rotation can be forgotten and keys can be exposed in logs."
Advanced Cloud Security Check,1,Keys are stored in private code repositories or configuration files.,-1,High risk. Exposes credentials to anyone with code access and makes rotation very difficult.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,1,Keys are hardcoded directly into the application source code.,-2,"Critical vulnerability. Leaking code means leaking all credentials, with no easy way to revoke them."
Advanced Cloud Security Check,1,We use the same long-lived key for all services.,-2,Extremely high risk. A single key compromise gives an attacker access to everything.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,2,"We use a multi-tiered VPC architecture with strict, least-privilege security groups and network ACLs for defense-in-depth.",2,Excellent. This layered defense model isolates resources and significantly limits an attacker's movement.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,2,We use a single VPC with security groups configured to allow traffic only from specific known IP addresses.,1,"Good control, but a flat network within the VPC means a compromised server can attack others."
Advanced Cloud Security Check,2,"We use a default VPC and rely on the default security group settings, which are somewhat permissive.",0,A neutral but risky state. Default settings are often too open for production workloads.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,2,Our security groups are configured to allow all traffic (0.0.0.0/0) on most ports for ease of access.,-2,Critical misconfiguration. Exposes all services on the instance to the entire internet.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,2,We don't use VPCs or security groups.,-2,This implies using legacy cloud services (like EC2-Classic) which is a major security risk.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,3,All data is encrypted at rest by default using customer-managed keys (CMK) with a defined key rotation policy.,2,Best practice. Provides maximum control and auditability over data encryption.

Advanced Cloud Security Check,4,"Logging is enabled for most critical services, and logs are reviewed manually during an incident.",1,"Good, but reactive. Lacks the proactive alerting needed to catch threats in real-time."
Advanced Cloud Security Check,4,Logging is enabled but logs are stored in the same account and are not centrally managed or monitored.,0,Logs are available but can be tampered with by an attacker who compromises the account.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,4,"Logging is enabled on only a few services, or we use the default settings.",-1,Major blind spots. You cannot investigate what you do not log.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,4,Logging is disabled to save costs.,-2,Critical visibility gap. Makes effective incident response nearly impossible.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,5,"IAM roles with granular, resource-specific permissions are used for all human and machine access. Permissions are reviewed quarterly.",2,"Excellent. A mature implementation of least privilege, reducing the blast radius of a compromise."
Advanced Cloud Security Check,5,"We use IAM groups with broad policies (e.g., PowerUser, ReadOnly) assigned to users.",1,"A good start, but broad policies often grant more permissions than necessary."
Advanced Cloud Security Check,5,"We attach policies directly to individual IAM users as needed, but rarely review or remove them.",-1,Leads to 'privilege creep' where users accumulate excessive permissions over time.
Advanced DCloud Security Check,5,Most developers and services use an IAM user with full administrator access for convenience.,-2,Critical risk. A compromise of any one of these users/services leads to a full environment compromise.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,5,We use the root account for all daily operations.,-2,Extremely dangerous practice. The root account should be locked away and never used for operational tasks.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,6,"We have an automated CI/CD pipeline that scans all container images and AMIs for vulnerabilities before deployment, blocking critical findings.",2,Best practice 'shift-left' security. Prevents vulnerabilities from ever reaching production.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,6,We run weekly automated vulnerability scans on all running instances and container repositories.,1,"Good detective control, but it means vulnerable systems may be live for up to a week."
Advanced Cloud Security Check,6,"We perform manual, ad-hoc vulnerability scans on our primary production servers a few times a year.",0,Infrequent scanning provides a poor and outdated picture of the actual risk.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,6,We rely on the security of the base images provided by the cloud provider or Docker Hub.,-1,Base images can contain vulnerabilities or become outdated. They must be scanned.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,6,We do not perform vulnerability scanning on our cloud workloads.,-2,Critical gap. Leaves systems exposed to well-known and easily exploitable vulnerabilities.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,7,"We use a managed DDoS protection service (e.g., AWS Shield Advanced, Azure DDoS Protection Standard) combined with a WAF and a CDN.",2,"A robust, multi-layered defense against volumetric and application-layer DDoS attacks."
Advanced Cloud Security Check,7,"We rely on the standard, default DDoS protection included with our cloud provider's services.",1,"Provides protection against common, large-scale attacks but not sophisticated application-layer attacks."
Advanced Cloud Security Check,7,"We have a WAF, but no specific, advanced DDoS mitigation service.",1,A WAF helps with application-layer attacks but may not be sufficient for large volumetric attacks.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,7,We have no specific DDoS protection in place.,-1,"High risk for any public-facing application, as even small DDoS attacks can cause an outage."
Advanced Cloud Security Check,7,We are not sure what DDoS protection is.,-2,Lack of awareness of a common and impactful threat is a major business risk.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,8,All third-party software from marketplaces undergoes a security review and is deployed in an isolated environment before production use.,2,A mature supply chain security process that minimizes risk from external code.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,8,"We only use software from well-known, reputable vendors found on the official cloud marketplace.",1,"A good practice, but even reputable software can have vulnerabilities."
Advanced Cloud Security Check,8,"We allow developers to use any third-party software they need to get their job done, without a formal review process.",-1,High risk. Introduces unknown and unvetted code into your secure environment.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,8,We are not aware of any third-party software running in our environment.,-1,Lack of awareness is a risk. It's likely third-party code exists in dependencies.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,8,We do not use any third-party software.,0,"Unlikely in modern development, but if true, it reduces this specific risk vector."
Advanced Cloud Security Check,9,"Databases are deployed in private subnets, require SSL/TLS for connections, have encryption at rest enabled, and use granular IAM database authentication.",2,Excellent layered security model for protecting critical data stores.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,9,Databases are in private subnets with access restricted by security groups to specific application servers.,1,"Good network-level protection, but lacks other defense-in-depth measures like IAM auth."
Advanced Cloud Security Check,9,Databases are publicly accessible but are protected by a strong password.,-1,High risk. Exposes the database to brute-force attacks and potential zero-day vulnerabilities from the internet.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,9,Databases are publicly accessible and use default port numbers with simple passwords.,-2,Critical misconfiguration. It is highly likely the database will be compromised.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,9,We are not sure how our databases are configured.,-1,Lack of awareness of the configuration of a critical asset is a major security risk.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,10,We use automated static analysis security testing (SAST) tools in our CI/CD pipeline to scan IaC templates for misconfigurations before deployment.,2,Best practice. Automates security and prevents misconfigurations from being deployed.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,10,We have a manual peer-review process for all infrastructure code changes to look for potential security issues.,1,"Good practice, but prone to human error and less scalable than automated tools."
Advanced Cloud Security Check,10,We use IaC but do not have a specific security review process for the templates.,-1,High risk. This can lead to the repeatable deployment of insecure infrastructure.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,10,We make changes to our cloud infrastructure manually through the web console.,-1,"Manual changes are error-prone, lack auditability, and lead to configuration drift."
Advanced Cloud Security Check,10,We do not use Infrastructure as Code.,0,"Neutral. While not a direct risk, it indicates a lack of maturity in cloud operations."
Advanced Cloud Security Check,11,"We use runtime security monitoring tools, enforce pod security policies (or equivalents), and run containers as non-root users with read-only filesystems where possible.",2,"A comprehensive, defense-in-depth approach to container security."
Advanced Cloud Security Check,11,We scan container images for vulnerabilities but do not have specific runtime security monitoring in place.,1,"Good 'shift-left' practice, but doesn't protect against threats that occur at runtime."
Advanced Cloud Security Check,11,"We run our containers using the default settings provided by the orchestration service (e.g., EKS, AKS).",0,Risky. Default settings are often too permissive for secure production environments.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,11,Our containers are run with root privileges for maximum compatibility.,-2,Critical risk. A container escape vulnerability would grant the attacker root access to the host node.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,11,We do not use containers.,0,Not applicable if containers are not in use.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,12,"MFA is enforced programmatically for all IAM users and the root account, and console access is federated through a central identity provider requiring MFA.",2,Gold standard for identity and access management in the cloud.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,12,MFA is enabled and required for all administrative users and the root account.,1,"Good practice that protects the most powerful accounts, but leaves others vulnerable."
Advanced Cloud Security Check,12,MFA is encouraged for all users but not strictly enforced by policy.,-1,Ineffective. Optional security is rarely adopted and provides a false sense of security.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,12,Only the root account has MFA enabled.,-2,"Critically insufficient. The root account should not be used for daily tasks, and regular user accounts are left exposed."
Advanced Cloud Security Check,12,MFA is not used for any account.,-2,Critical vulnerability. Makes password-based attacks like credential stuffing trivial.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,13,We have a well-documented and tested multi-region DR plan with automated failover for critical services and regular cross-region backup replication.,2,Excellent. A mature and robust plan to ensure business continuity.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,13,"We have regular backups of our data and infrastructure templates stored in a different region, with a manual recovery process documented.",1,"Good practice. Provides recoverability, though manual processes can be slow and error-prone."
Advanced Cloud Security Check,13,We have backups stored in the same region as our primary infrastructure.,-1,High risk. A region-wide failure would destroy both the primary infrastructure and the backups.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,13,We rely on the high availability of a single cloud region to prevent outages.,-2,Critically risky. Single-region high availability does not protect against region-wide disasters or failures.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,13,We do not have a disaster recovery plan.,-2,A major business risk that threatens the continuity of the entire operation.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,14,We have a centralized security alerting system (from SIEM/monitoring tools) with automated response actions for common events and a 24/7 on-call rotation.,2,"A mature, proactive security operations model."
Advanced Cloud Security Check,14,We receive email alerts from cloud security services and respond to them manually during business hours.,1,"Good, but can lead to significant delays in response, especially for overnight incidents."
Advanced Cloud Security Check,14,We periodically log in to the cloud console to check for any security notifications.,-1,A reactive and ineffective approach. Threats can cause significant damage before being noticed.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,14,We assume the cloud provider handles all security events.,-2,A critical misunderstanding of the Shared Responsibility Model. The customer is responsible for security *in* the cloud.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,14,We do not monitor for security events.,-2,"Complete lack of visibility into threats, attacks, and misconfigurations."
Advanced Cloud Security Check,15,"Each serverless function has a unique IAM execution role with narrowly scoped, least-privilege permissions. Function dependencies are scanned for vulnerabilities.",2,"Excellent. A granular, secure-by-design approach to serverless security."
Advanced Cloud Security Check,15,"Functions use shared execution roles with broader permissions based on their general purpose (e.g., 'database-access-role').",1,"A common practice, but it often grants functions more permissions than they strictly need."
Advanced Cloud Security Check,15,"All functions run under a single, highly permissive execution role for simplicity.",-1,High risk. A vulnerability in one function could be exploited to abuse the permissions of all other functions.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,15,Our functions have administrator-level permissions to avoid any access issues.,-2,Critical risk. A compromise of a single function would lead to a full environment compromise.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,15,We do not use serverless functions.,0,Not applicable if serverless functions are not in use.
GDPR Compliance Audit,1,"We have a documented lawful basis for each data processing activity, which is reviewed and included in our privacy notice.",2,Excellent. Demonstrates a clear understanding and implementation of a core GDPR principle.
GDPR Compliance Audit,1,"We primarily rely on user consent, obtained via clear affirmative action, for all our data processing.",1,"Good, but consent is not always the only or best basis. It's important to understand all six lawful bases."
GDPR Compliance Audit,1,We process data based on our 'legitimate interests' but have not performed or documented a formal balancing test.,-1,High compliance risk. Using legitimate interests without a documented LIA is not compliant.
GDPR Compliance Audit,1,We assume we have a right to process the data we collect.,-2,Critical compliance failure. Processing without a lawful basis is a major infringement.
GDPR Compliance Audit,1,We are not sure what a 'lawful basis' is.,-2,Indicates a fundamental lack of understanding of GDPR requirements.
GDPR Compliance Audit,2,"We have a clear, documented process and a dedicated contact point for handling data subject requests within the one-month time limit.",2,Best practice. Ensures you can meet your legal obligations efficiently and correctly.
GDPR Compliance Audit,2,We handle requests on an ad-hoc basis as they come in via email or support tickets.,0,"Risky. An ad-hoc process can easily miss the legal deadline, leading to a compliance breach."
GDPR Compliance Audit,2,We have received requests but are unsure how to process them or if we have to comply.,-1,High risk of non-compliance. Ignoring or improperly handling requests can lead to complaints and fines.
GDPR Compliance Audit,2,We tell users we are unable to delete their data.,-2,"A direct violation of data subject rights under GDPR, unless a specific legal exemption applies."
GDPR Compliance Audit,2,We have never received a data subject request.,0,"Neutral, but it's crucial to have a process in place for when a request is eventually received."
GDPR Compliance Audit,3,"Yes, we have formally appointed a DPO with the necessary expertise and have registered them with the relevant supervisory authority.",2,"Excellent. Correctly implemented where required, showing mature governance."
GDPR Compliance Audit,3,"We have assigned data protection responsibilities to an existing employee, but not as a formal DPO role.",1,"A good step, but may not meet the formal requirements if a DPO is mandatory for your organization."
GDPR Compliance Audit,3,We use an external consultant for data protection advice but have no appointed DPO.,0,"May be compliant if a DPO is not mandatory, but risky if one is required."
GDPR Compliance Audit,3,We are a small company and believe we do not need a DPO.,-1,"A risky assumption. The need for a DPO is based on processing activities, not just company size."
GDPR Compliance Audit,3,We do not know what a DPO is.,-2,Indicates a significant gap in understanding GDPR's governance requirements.
GDPR Compliance Audit,4,We have a formal process where a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is conducted for all new projects involving personal data.,2,"Excellent. This embeds privacy into your operations, as required by GDPR."
GDPR Compliance Audit,4,"We consider privacy during the design phase of new products, but the process is informal.",1,"A good cultural practice, but an informal process can be inconsistent and hard to prove to regulators."
GDPR Compliance Audit,4,We try to add privacy features after a product has been built if a concern is raised.,-1,A reactive approach that goes against the core principle of 'by Design and by Default'.
GDPR Compliance Audit,4,We prioritize functionality first and consider privacy only if required by customers.,-2,A direct contradiction of the 'Data Protection by Design' principle.
GDPR Compliance Audit,4,We are not familiar with this principle.,-2,A fundamental gap in knowledge of GDPR's core operational requirements.
GDPR Compliance Audit,5,"We have a documented internal procedure for assessing and reporting breaches to the supervisory authority within 72 hours, as part of our Incident Response Plan.",2,Best practice. Ensures you can meet the tight and mandatory reporting deadline.
GDPR Compliance Audit,5,We know we need to report breaches and would contact our legal advisor to do so if one occurred.,1,"Good awareness, but not having a pre-defined internal process can cause critical delays."
GDPR Compliance Audit,5,We would only report a breach if it was very large or if customers complained.,-2,"Non-compliant. All breaches posing a risk to individuals must be reported, not just large ones."
GDPR Compliance Audit,5,We believe we are not required to report data breaches.,-2,"A critical misunderstanding of GDPR obligations, which can lead to significant fines."
GDPR Compliance Audit,5,We do not have a process for this.,-1,"High risk. Without a process, meeting the 72-hour deadline is nearly impossible."
GDPR Compliance Audit,6,"Yes, we maintain a comprehensive and up-to-date RoPA that is regularly reviewed and made available to supervisory authorities upon request.",2,"Excellent. This meets a core, mandatory documentation requirement of GDPR."
GDPR Compliance Audit,6,"We have a spreadsheet that lists our main data processing activities, but it is not fully detailed or regularly updated.",1,"A good start, but an incomplete or outdated RoPA does not meet the legal requirement."
GDPR Compliance Audit,6,"We have some documentation on data flows for specific projects, but not a central record.",-1,"Insufficient. GDPR requires a central, comprehensive Record of Processing Activities."
GDPR Compliance Audit,6,We do not maintain a record of our processing activities.,-2,A direct breach of a mandatory GDPR documentation requirement (Article 30).
GDPR Compliance Audit,6,We do not know what a RoPA is.,-2,A critical knowledge gap regarding a key GDPR accountability obligation.
GDPR Compliance Audit,7,"We have signed Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) with all third-party vendors, and we conduct periodic reviews of their security and compliance measures.",2,"A mature, best-practice approach to managing supply chain and data processor risk."
GDPR Compliance Audit,7,We have DPAs in place with our major vendors.,1,"Good practice, but GDPR requires a DPA with *all* processors, not just major ones."
GDPR Compliance Audit,7,"We check the vendor's privacy policy before using their service, but do not have formal agreements.",-1,Insufficient. A privacy policy is not a substitute for a legally binding DPA.
GDPR Compliance Audit,7,We use vendors without a formal data protection review process.,-2,High risk. You are liable for breaches caused by your data processors if you haven't performed due diligence.
GDPR Compliance Audit,7,We do not share personal data with any third-party vendors.,0,"Reduces this specific risk, but this is rare for modern businesses."
GDPR Compliance Audit,8,"All international data transfers are mapped and conducted using a valid transfer mechanism, such as the UK's International Data Transfer Agreement or Adequacy decisions.",2,Excellent. Demonstrates a clear and compliant approach to a complex area of GDPR.
GDPR Compliance Audit,8,"We are aware some of our vendors are outside the UK/EEA and believe they are compliant, but have not documented the transfer mechanism.",-1,"Belief is not sufficient for compliance. You must have a valid, documented transfer mechanism in place."
GDPR Compliance Audit,8,"We transfer data to vendors globally without a specific legal mechanism in place, assuming it's okay.",-2,A direct breach of GDPR's rules on international data transfers.
GDPR Compliance Audit,8,We are not sure where our data is stored or transferred.,-1,A significant governance failure. You must know where the personal data you control is going.
GDPR Compliance Audit,8,We do not transfer any data internationally.,0,"Simplifies compliance, but ensure this is accurate (e.g., check where your cloud provider stores data)."
GDPR Compliance Audit,9,"We have a data retention policy with specific periods for all categories of personal data, and an automated process for deletion or anonymization.",2,Best practice. This operationalizes the GDPR principle of storage limitation.
GDPR Compliance Audit,9,We have general guidelines for data retention but the deletion process is manual and ad-hoc.,1,"A good start, but a manual process is prone to error and data being kept for too long."
GDPR Compliance Audit,9,We keep most data indefinitely unless a user specifically asks for it to be deleted.,-2,A direct violation of the storage limitation principle. Data should not be kept forever 'just in case'.
GDPR Compliance Audit,9,We have never deleted any personal data we have collected.,-2,This indicates a systemic failure to comply with the storage limitation principle.
GDPR Compliance Audit,9,We do not have a data retention policy.,-1,High compliance risk. You must be able to justify why you are still holding personal data.
GDPR Compliance Audit,10,"Our privacy notice is written in plain language, easily accessible from all data collection points, and reviewed regularly for accuracy and compliance.",2,Excellent. This meets the GDPR requirements for transparency and accessibility.
GDPR Compliance Audit,10,We have a comprehensive privacy policy linked in our website footer.,1,"Good, but must also be actively provided at the point of data collection ('just-in-time' notice)."
GDPR Compliance Audit,10,Our privacy policy is a long legal document that is difficult for a non-lawyer to understand.,-1,"Fails the GDPR requirement for information to be provided in 'a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language'."
GDPR Compliance Audit,10,We do not have a privacy notice or policy.,-2,A critical compliance failure that violates the core principle of transparency.
GDPR Compliance Audit,10,We use a generic privacy policy template we found online.,-1,High risk. A template is not specific to your data processing activities and is likely non-compliant.
