23,C,"High Priority: Implement a centralized logging solution. Without it, investigating a security incident is nearly impossible. This can be as simple as forwarding logs to a dedicated server."
23,D,"Critical: Begin collecting security logs from your critical systems (firewalls, servers). Without logs, you are blind to what is happening on your network."
23,E,Recommendation: Research Security Information and Event Management (SIEM). The core idea is to collect all security logs into one place for easier analysis.
24,A,Excellent. This is the gold standard and the single most important defense against account takeover attacks.
24,B,"Good. Protecting privileged accounts is the highest priority. Plan to expand MFA to all users, especially for email and critical applications."
24,C,"High Priority: Change your MFA policy from 'optional' to 'mandatory' for all users, or at the very least, for all administrative and remote access accounts."
24,D,"Recommendation: Re-evaluate your use of MFA. It should be applied to your most critical systems first, such as email, financial applications, and administrator logins."
24,E,"Critical: Implement MFA immediately, starting with all administrative accounts and external-facing services like email. Passwords alone are no longer sufficient."
25,A,Excellent. This comprehensive data protection strategy is aligned with modern best practices.
25,B,High Priority: Implement encryption at rest for your sensitive data. This protects you if a physical server or hard drive is stolen.
25,C,High Priority: Conduct a data audit to identify all locations of sensitive data and ensure it is encrypted both at rest and in transit.
25,D,Critical: You must determine if and how your sensitive data is encrypted. Assume it is not protected and investigate immediately.
25,E,Critical: Implement encryption for all sensitive data. Start with SSL/TLS for data in transit and then investigate options like database and full-disk encryption for data at rest.
26,A,Excellent. This proactive combination of automated scanning and manual testing is the best practice for vulnerability management.
26,B,"Good. This is a great proactive security measure. To mature your program, consider adding an annual third-party penetration test to find more complex vulnerabilities."

26,D,High Priority: Research and conduct a vulnerability scan of your network and website. There are many affordable and free tools available to get started.
26,E,Critical: Begin a vulnerability management program immediately by running a scan on your external-facing systems. You need to find your security holes before an attacker does.
27,A,Excellent. This is the gold standard for building a security-aware culture and a strong human firewall.
27,B,"Good. This is a solid foundation. To improve, implement annual refresher training and consider periodic phishing tests."
27,C,"High Priority: Implement a formal, structured security awareness training program for all employees. Occasional emails are not effective."
27,D,Critical: This assumption is incorrect and dangerous. Immediately implement a security awareness training program for all staff. Humans are a primary target for attackers.
27,E,"Critical: Implement a security awareness training program immediately. Your employees are your first line of defense, and they need to be trained to spot and report threats."
28,A,Excellent. Your process ensures that data leakage from disposed assets is highly unlikely.
28,B,"Good. This is a solid practice. For higher security, consider using data destruction software that overwrites the data multiple times."
28,C,Critical: Immediately change your process. 'Deleting' files does not remove them. You must use a secure data wiping tool to sanitize hard drives before disposal.
28,D,Critical: Stop this practice immediately. You are leaking sensitive company and customer data. All storage devices must be securely wiped or physically destroyed before disposal.
28,E,High Priority: Establish a formal policy and process for asset disposal that includes secure data wiping or physical destruction of storage media.
29,A,Excellent. An automated and rapid patch management process is a sign of a mature security program.
29,B,"Good. A disciplined manual process is effective. To improve, look into patch management tools that can automate the deployment and reporting."
29,C,"High Priority: Move from a reactive 'break-fix' model to a proactive, scheduled patching process. Waiting for a problem means you are already compromised."
29,D,Critical: Implement a formal patch management process immediately. Unpatched systems are the most common way attackers gain entry to a network.
