Advanced Cloud Security Check,Access Management,45,"How do you secure serverless functions (e.g., Lambda, Azure Functions)?","If you use serverless computing, this checks how you control the permissions of each function to ensure it only accesses the specific resources it needs (least privilege).","Each serverless function has a unique IAM execution role with narrowly scoped, least-privilege permissions. Function dependencies are scanned for vulnerabilities.","Excellent. A granular, secure-by-design approach to serverless security.",2,Excellent. This granular approach provides optimal serverless security.

Roles exist but implement function-specific permissions for least privilege.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,Access Management,45,"How do you secure serverless functions (e.g., Lambda, Azure Functions)?","If you use serverless computing, this checks how you control the permissions of each function to ensure it only accesses the specific resources it needs (least privilege).","All functions run under a single, highly permissive execution role for simplicity.",High risk. A vulnerability in one function could be exploited to abuse the permissions of all other functions.,-1,Poor. Overly permissive roles create risk. Implement function-specific roles.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,Access Management,45,"How do you secure serverless functions (e.g., Lambda, Azure Functions)?","If you use serverless computing, this checks how you control the permissions of each function to ensure it only accesses the specific resources it needs (least privilege).",Our functions have administrator-level permissions to avoid any access issues.,Critical risk. A compromise of a single function would lead to a full environment compromise.,-2,Very Poor. Administrator permissions create extreme risk. Implement least privilege immediately.
Advanced Cloud Security Check,Access Management,45,"How do you secure serverless functions (e.g., Lambda, Azure Functions)?","If you use serverless computing, this checks how you control the permissions of each function to ensure it only accesses the specific resources it needs (least privilege).",We do not use serverless functions.,Not applicable if serverless functions are not in use.,0,"Fair. Not applicable, but consider serverless benefits for scalability."
