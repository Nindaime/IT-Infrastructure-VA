Standard ITIVA Assessment,Cyber Security Implementations,29,Do you have a system in place for managing and applying security patches in a timely manner?,Checks if you have an organized process for regularly installing security updates on all your software and systems to fix vulnerabilities as they are discovered.,"Yes, we use an automated patch management system that applies critical patches within days.","A mature, proactive process that minimizes the window of exploitation for new vulnerabilities.",2,Excellent. An automated and rapid patch management process is a sign of mature security.
Standard ITIVA Assessment,Cyber Security Implementations,29,Do you have a system in place for managing and applying security patches in a timely manner?,Checks if you have an organized process for regularly installing security updates on all your software and systems to fix vulnerabilities as they are discovered.,"Yes, we have a manual process to check for and apply patches monthly.","A good, disciplined process, though slower than automated systems.",1,"Good. A disciplined manual process is effective. To improve, look into patch management tools."
Standard ITIVA Assessment,Cyber Security Implementations,29,Do you have a system in place for managing and applying security patches in a timely manner?,Checks if you have an organized process for regularly installing security updates on all your software and systems to fix vulnerabilities as they are discovered.,We only patch systems when we encounter a problem.,A reactive 'break-fix' approach that guarantees systems remain vulnerable for long periods.,-1,High Priority: Move from reactive to proactive patching. Waiting for problems means you're already compromised.
Standard ITIVA Assessment,Cyber Security Implementations,29,Do you have a system in place for managing and applying security patches in a timely manner?,Checks if you have an organized process for regularly installing security updates on all your software and systems to fix vulnerabilities as they are discovered.,We do not have a formal patching process.,"A critical failure in security maintenance, leading to a build-up of easily exploitable vulnerabilities.",-2,Critical: Implement a formal patch management process immediately. Unpatched systems are the most common attack vector.
Standard ITIVA Assessment,Cyber Security Implementations,29,Do you have a system in place for managing and applying security patches in a timely manner?,Checks if you have an organized process for regularly installing security updates on all your software and systems to fix vulnerabilities as they are discovered.,I don't know.,"A significant operational risk, as unpatched systems are a primary target for attackers.",-1,Critical: Designate a person or team responsible for applying security patches monthly.
Standard ITIVA Assessment,Cyber Security Implementations,30,Is access to sensitive data and systems restricted based on the principle of least privilege?,"Determines if employees are only given the minimum level of access to data and systems that they need to perform their job, reducing the risk of data breaches.","Yes, access rights are strictly controlled and regularly reviewed based on job roles.","The gold standard for access control, minimizing the potential impact of any single account compromise.",2,Excellent. This demonstrates a mature and effective access control program.
Standard ITIVA Assessment,Cyber Security Implementations,30,Is access to sensitive data and systems restricted based on the principle of least privilege?,"Determines if employees are only given the minimum level of access to data and systems that they need to perform their job, reducing the risk of data breaches.","Yes, we have different levels of access for different groups of employees.","A good, foundational access control model.",1,"Good. This is a foundational practice. To improve, implement periodic access reviews."
Standard ITIVA Assessment,Cyber Security Implementations,30,Is access to sensitive data and systems restricted based on the principle of least privilege?,"Determines if employees are only given the minimum level of access to data and systems that they need to perform their job, reducing the risk of data breaches.","Access is granted on request, but rarely revoked or reviewed.","Known as 'privilege creep,' this creates a massive internal attack surface over time.",-1,High Priority: Implement regular access reviews to identify and revoke unnecessary permissions.
Standard ITIVA Assessment,Cyber Security Implementations,30,Is access to sensitive data and systems restricted based on the principle of least privilege?,"Determines if employees are only given the minimum level of access to data and systems that they need to perform their job, reducing the risk of data breaches.",Most employees have access to most data.,A critical risk. A compromise of any user account could lead to a full company data breach.,-2,Critical: Immediately begin implementing the Principle of Least Privilege. Start by identifying data types and creating user roles.
Standard ITIVA Assessment,Cyber Security Implementations,30,Is access to sensitive data and systems restricted based on the principle of least privilege?,"Determines if employees are only given the minimum level of access to data and systems that they need to perform their job, reducing the risk of data breaches.",I don't know.,"Indicates a lack of basic access control, a fundamental security principle.",-1,High Priority: Research and implement the Principle of Least Privilege. Users should only have access to what they need.
